# TIPS

1. **Don't be a deadliner :)**<br>
I recommend you to do the assignments from Monday since the assignments has appeared, if you want to enjoy your weekend.

2. **Improve your Googling skills**<br>
In this os lecture, you will learn about GSGS which is stands for "Google Sana, Google Sini". You can ask the teaching assistant actually, but they'll push you to be independent in this course. So, dont be lazy in terms of googling if you want to pass this course with good result (hope you got A in OS :D)
